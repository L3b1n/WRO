# Sumo

Here I locate 3D models and programs for robo sumo.

## Models
* [#sumo](./#sumo.lxf) - Model for sumo 15x15 based on two large nxt motors and wheels ø62,4x20
* [sumo_2](./sumo_2.lxf) - Model for sumo 15x15 based on four large ev3 motors and wheels ø62,4x20. Currently without color sensor.
* [sumo](./sumo.lxf) - Three similar modeles for sumo: two for 20x20 and one for 15x15. They all base on two lagre lego technic motors and wheels ø62,4x20. Absolutely need some fixes in the ladle part.

## Program
* [#sumo](./#sumo.ev3) - Basic program for sumo that was written on ev3
